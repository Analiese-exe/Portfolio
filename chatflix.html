            <div class="p">
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> Picture this: you’re watching the latest hit show on Netflix, and you’re dying to share your reactions with friends in real-time. But, you have to hop on another app to chat, losing some of the show’s magic along the way. It’s a total buzzkill, right?</p>

            <h2>3. Research</h2>
            <p><strong>User Interviews:</strong>We conducted in-depth interviews with a small but insightful group of five Netflix users, all students and friends. While our sample size was limited, their enthusiasm for the concept was notable. They particularly liked the idea of a 'virtual house party' - watching shows together while chatting in real-time. This aligns with broader trends we've observed in social media and streaming platforms.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong>We examined how other major streaming platforms like Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ handle social interaction features. By scrutinizing their approaches to integrating chat and real-time communication, we gathered best practices and identified potential pitfalls to enhance the Chatflix experience on Netflix.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
            <ol class="second-list">
              <li>Users are all about discussing content in real-time. It’s like watching with a virtual crowd.</li>
              <li>A surprising number of users are already juggling secondary devices or platforms to chat while they watch. Talk about multitasking!</li>
