            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Client:</strong> Personal Project</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 Weeks</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer</p>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Vega-Lite</p>

            <h2>Background and Context</h2>
            <p>
                In an increasingly globalized world, the need to quickly and accurately convert currencies is more important than ever. Whether for business, travel, or online shopping, having access to up-to-date exchange rates is crucial. While there are numerous currency conversion tools available, many lack intuitive design and visual elements that help users understand exchange rate trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project aims to create a user-friendly currency converter app with a sleek design and a graph feature to visualize currency exchange trends, providing users with both immediate conversion results and insights into historical data.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The primary goal of this project was to design a currency converter app that not only performs quick conversions but also includes a graph to display historical currency exchange rates. The app should be simple to use, visually appealing, and informative, offering a superior user experience compared to existing apps.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>1. Ideation and Sketching</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the insights gathered, I sketched out several design concepts focusing on simplicity and functionality. The main features identified were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currency Conversion Tool</li>
                <li>Exchange Rate Graph</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
                Using Figma, I developed wireframes to lay out the appâ€™s structure, including a simple home screen with an input field for selecting currencies and entering amounts, and a graph feature for displaying historical rates.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Adding the Graph Feature</h3>
            <p>
                To enhance the user experience, I integrated a graph feature using Vega-Lite, which displays a line graph of exchange rates over a customizable period.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
                The visual design focused on a clean, modern look with a minimalistic color palette to ensure readability and reduce cognitive load.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The final design of the currency converter app was well-received by test users who appreciated the clean interface and the ability to view historical trends directly within the app.
